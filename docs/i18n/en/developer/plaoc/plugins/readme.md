`plaoc` is a cross-platform web application development toolkit based on the DwebBrowser platform, comparable to `Cordova`, `Capacitor`, and `Tauri`.

Front-end code running in the web provides API call interfaces for communication with the backend, as well as further encapsulated `WebComponent` components.
