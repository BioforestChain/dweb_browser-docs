# Plaoc App

We define applications that run on the DwebBrowser browser and are collectively called `Plaoc App`. plaoc follows web specifications and provides a series of plug-ins to control node hardware. And based on the network module, mutual communication of apps within nodes and between nodes can be realized.

Because dweb-browser currently supports mainstream platforms like Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows, Linux, your web application can rely on plaoc to directly implement multi-end publishing.

Plaoc is a product of web3. Applications will be relatively independent, so each plaoc application package can be published using its own application website.

Of course, your website can also be an application center, containing your application matrix, making application publishing more efficient.

## Plaoc app development process

First you need to create a manifest.json file in the root directory of your application. You can think of manifest.json as equivalent to PWA's manifest.json.

It mainly declares some application parameters and does some display when the user installs.

```bash
  plaoc-app
  ├── ......Other project files
  └── manifest.json
```

The following sample configuration file, copy the following content and paste it into manifest.json in the root directory.[Click to view field details](./manifest.md);

```json
{
  "id": "game.dweb.waterbang.top.dweb",
  "name": "game",
  "short_name": "vue3-game",
  "description": "这是一个实例应用，包含了dweb_plugins全部组件的实例。",
  "logo": "https://www.bfmeta.info/imgs/logo3.webp",
  "images": [
    "http://qiniu-waterbang.waterbang.top/bfm/cot-home_2058.webp",
    "http://qiniu-waterbang.waterbang.top/bfm/defi.png",
    "http://qiniu-waterbang.waterbang.top/bfm/nft.png"
  ],
  "author": ["bfs", "bfs@bfs.com"],
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "change_log": "changelog",
  "home": "https://dweb.waterbang.top",
  "categories": ["application"],
  "lang": "zh-Hans",
  "languages": []
}
```

Now your app has been declared as a Plaoc app.

## How to start development

### First install @plaoc/cli

> Or use npx to run without polluting the global environment
>
> Example: `npx plaoc bundle ./usr/www`

@plaoc/cli is the development tool for plaoc that helps applications run, package, and publish. Specific command prompts can be viewed using --help or [Documentation](./cli.md).

- Execute the installation command:

::: code-group
```bash [PNPM]
  pnpm add -g @plaoc/cli
```

```bash [YARN]
  yarn global add @plaoc/cli
```

```bash [NPM]
  npm i -g @plaoc/cli
```

:::

### Start the project

This example uses vite to start the project:

```bash
  npx vite --host
```

The terminal outputs

```bash
 VITE v4.4.9  ready in 88 ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: http://192.168.0.100:5173/
```

### Build app data link

Use the plaoc command installed above to build:

```bash
  plaoc serve http://192.168.0.100:5173/
  #or
  npx plaoc serve http://192.168.0.100:5173/
```

The terminal outputs

```bash
  metadata:       http://127.0.0.1:8096/metadata.json
  metadata:       http://192.168.0.100:8096/metadata.json
```

> You can use plaoc serve --help to see more features.

### Start development

First you need to download the [dweb-browser desktop](https://github.com/BioforestChain/dweb_browser/releases) according to your operating system.

Next, run dweb-browser with the command to start developer mode.

::: code-group

```bash [Windows]
& "D:\DownLoads\Dweb Browser-x.x.x.exe" install --url http://192.168.0.100:8096/metadata.json
```

```bash [MacOS]
open /Applications/Dweb\ Browser.app --args install --url http://127.0.0.1:8096/metadata.json
```

:::

Now you can see the development and debugging interface. You should also find that what you just downloaded is also the desktop version of dweb-browser.

### Package

After plaoc-app development is complete, @plaoc/cli is still used to package the app. The command is as follows:

```bash
plaoc bundle ./dist
```

> ./dist is the output source directory for packaging

### Publish

Upload to the public plaoc app store or upload to your app's official website. For information about how to provide downloads from the official app website or how to provide downloads from the app store, visit: [App Store](./app-store.md).

If you have installed the Dweb Browser app on your phone, you can first upload the two files you packaged to the same folder, and then generate the QR code from the metadata.json address.

```bash
dweb://install?url=http://example.com/app1/metadata.json
```

Then use your phone's deep_link function to scan the QR code generated by the link above. After the scan is completed, you will jump to the interface for downloading the app.
