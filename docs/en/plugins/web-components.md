`plaoc` is a "cross-platform web application" development toolkit based on the `dweb-browser` platform that benchmarks `Cordova`, `Capacitor`, and `Tauri`.

The front-end code running in the Web provides API calling interfaces for communicating with the back-end, as well as further encapsulated `WebComponent` components.
